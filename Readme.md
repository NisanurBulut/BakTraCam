Every maintenance has a type, status and period information. When the user selects a period while creating maintenance, repetitive maintenance can occur automatically.There are two types of users. These are: Responsible user and maintainer. Responsible user can create announcements. Announcements are listed on the main page. </p>

While the database is Sqlite, angular FrameWork is used on the front side. Repository design pattern and unit of work design pattern are used on the backend side. API development was made with Asp.Net Core 3.1. Interface components were created using the Angular Material library.
